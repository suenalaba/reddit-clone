How session works and how data flows:

req.session.userId = userId; -> storing some data into session
-> take any data and send to redis

{userId: 1} -> send that to redis

1.
#stored in redis as:
give redis key -> redis give data
sess: qwoeijwojerw -> {userId: 1}

2.
express-session middleware will set a cookie on my browser afdfosjfsojfosjfs
cookie value is signed version of the key for redis

3.
when user makes a request
afdfosjfsojfosjfs -> sent to server

4.
decrypt the cookie and get the key for reddis based on the secret
afdfosjfsojfosjfs -> qwoeijwojerw

5.
make a request to redis using session key and get the data
qwoeijwojerw -> {userId: 1}
