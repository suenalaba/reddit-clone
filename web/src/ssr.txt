me -> browse http://localhost:3000
make request -> next.js server
which makes request to graphsql server -> localhost:4000
-> building the HTML
-> sending back to the your browser(the client)

In Next.js, after you've loaded a single page, the pages after that are not SSR, it will switch
eg, if click back, it will do client site routing to go back to home page. (load from browser since next.js will change cause it has loaded before)
